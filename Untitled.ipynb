    "In Python, the \"pass by assignment\" concept is applied. Immutable objects are effectively passed by value because any modifications made to the function parameter do not affect the original object. Mutable objects, on the other hand, are effectively passed by reference because changes made within the function can affect the original object. It's important to consider the mutability of objects when working with function arguments in Python."
